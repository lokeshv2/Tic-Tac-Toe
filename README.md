# Tic-Tac-Toe
<br>
Tic-Tac-Toe, also known as Noughts and Crosses, is a simple two-player paper-and-pencil game played on a 3x3 grid where players take turns marking spaces with "X" or "O", aiming to be the first to get three in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally). This is a simple and interactive Tic Tac Toe game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Players take turns to mark X and O on the grid, with automatic win detection and the option to reset or start a new game.
